## Question
What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?

The population of Des Moines and New York is drastically different. Des Moines has 216,853 while New York has over 8 million citizens. This seems like it could be a major factor, but other areas of New York and Des Moines match up, which makes them a good comparison.

## Tableau Story

### Page 1
We start with a splash page, showing off some of Des Moines biking styles.

### Page 2
Information on the New York Citi Bike share program and how successful it is

### Page 3
Comparison of New York to Des Moines, but also showing that Des Moines is a city on the rise, it growth rate is outpacing New York City, and shows that it will continue to be a growing city. 

### Page 4
This shows that Des Moines and New York have similar temperature patterns, and will have similar ride usage when it comes to bike riding. We would expect peak times to be in the summer months.

### Page 5
Des Moines has a higher percentage of work force population, and lower income and commute time, this would encourage bike riding as a cheaper alternative.

### Page 6
Unlike New York and its urban living, Des Moines has more open land, and has many dedicated Bike Trails.

## Conclusion

While Des Moines has a smaller population, it is fertile ground to grow a bike sharing business. With ample space, bike trails, and a population with short commute times, there is lots of potential growth. As the city continues to grow, and tourism grows in the city, so will the business of a Bike share company.
